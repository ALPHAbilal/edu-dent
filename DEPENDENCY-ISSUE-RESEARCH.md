# Next.js Dependency Installation Issues - Expert Research Prompt

## Current Situation

I have a Next.js 15.4.4 application where I've added dependencies to package.json, but they're not actually installed. The application is failing with "Module not found" errors for:
- `@pinecone-database/pinecone`
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (previously)
- Possibly other dependencies

## Error Details

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@pinecone-database/pinecone'
> 1 | import { Pinecone } from '@pinecone-database/pinecone';
```

## What I Need to Know

### 1. Why aren't dependencies installing?
- Is this a Windows WSL issue?
- Is there a package-lock.json conflict?
- Are there peer dependency issues?
- Is there a npm cache problem?

### 2. Best Solutions for Next.js 15.4.4
- Should I delete node_modules and package-lock.json?
- Should I use `npm install --force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`?
- Is there a specific npm version required for Next.js 15?
- Should I use a different package manager (yarn, pnpm)?

### 3. Alternative Approaches
- Can I make ALL external dependencies optional?
- How to create a minimal build that works without these packages?
- Best way to conditionally import packages in Next.js?
- How to handle missing dependencies gracefully?

### 4. Quick Fix vs Proper Solution
- What's the fastest way to get the app running NOW?
- What's the proper long-term solution?
- How to prevent this in the future?

## My Environment
- Windows with WSL
- Next.js 15.4.4
- Node version: (need to check)
- npm version: (need to check)
- Working directory: `/mnt/f/my/edu-dent`
